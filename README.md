# Hide Spotify From Dock

Spotify app icon is always shown in the OS X Dock when opened, which is taking space and making the other icons smaller. I was fed up always searching on the internet how to hide it so I made a script for it - and a GitHub repository so I never lose it.

## Usage
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4ian/hide-spotify-from-dock/master/hide-spotify-from-dock.sh | bash
```

Restart Spotify. You're done ‚úåÔ∏è

I've [defined a hotkey](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/167967/creating-system-wide-keyboard-shortcut-to-launch-applications) (<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>~</kbd>) to open Spotify. Very handy! üåü
